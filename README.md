# Image metrics
This repository implements a range of important image metrics in python.
The image metrics are made to be used with image arrays where we are only 
interested in measuring the error within and ROI or mask. 

Currently the following are implemented: 
```python
RMSRE (Root Mean Squared Relative Error) 
MARE (Mean Absolute Relative Error)
RelativeErrorImage 
```
